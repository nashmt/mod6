# Choice of Database
# Status: accepted
# Context:
For Assignment 6, we were given the option to begin with a working example in which the database was already selected, or to add on to our Module 4 application.
# Decision:
I chose to start with the working example, in which MongoDB was chosen, because my Module 4 assignment lacked full functionality. Additionally, I reasoned that if I could get the working example to work properly with Ansible, then I could work on my Mod 4 assignment for the extra credit.
# Consequences:
I will most likely have an easier time with troubleshooting and debugging by starting with the working example and cross-referencing the number of other examples provided to us in class.
